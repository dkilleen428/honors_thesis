# UC Berkeley Data Science Honors Thesis

It is evident certain carbon credits originate from low-quality projects that prioritize emission avoidance rather than removal. Many companies initially sought out these less effective projects until social pressures were placed upon them for attempting to cheat the system. The motivation behind this project is to analyze the effectiveness of various pressures in encouraging large corporations to invest in carbon credits in the first place, and what types of pressures encourage companies to invest in types of credits that prove to be more effective.

The data for this project comes from the Voluntary Registry Offsets Database that was created by the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. The Berkeley Carbon Trading Project developed a database that contains all of the entries from these four registries and contains all carbon offset projects, credit issuances, and credit retirements for these projects and is under the reative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0) license.
