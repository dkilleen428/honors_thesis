# Preliminary ideas for UC Berkeley Data Science Honors Thesis

Through this thesis I would ideally like to explore the nature of carbon credits and the nuances behind their effectiveness. There is literature that claims how they are ineffective and allow companies to 
disregard their carbon emissions, however they do tend to financially support important climate projects such as reforestation and carbon sequestration. 

The main question I am aiming to address will ultimately be “how can we make the concept of carbon credits more effective?” I will first start with investigating whether or not they are effective in the first place. There is already a good amount of research proving that they do not fully offset carbon emissions as companies claim that they do. I would like to dive deeper into how carbon credits are traded and bought to focus on the way businesses, especially in the airline and oil and gas industries use carbon credits for things that were not their intended use.
